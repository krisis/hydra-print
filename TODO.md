A staging ground for small TODOs.  These could be promoted to github
issues at some point.

 * Put the name/title on each tile
 * indicate blankness for unused tiles?
 * keep tiles for exited streams around for a couple seconds.

 * add wnoutrefresh to hscurses lib (and use it) 
   (Then maybe get more sophisticated about when to do updates)
 
BUGS
---- 

 * Existing windows blank when new ones are added.
